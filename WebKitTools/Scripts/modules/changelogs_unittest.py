        Only add Cygwin to the path when it isn't already there.  This avoids
        causing problems for people who purposefully have non-Cygwin versions of
        executables like svn in front of the Cygwin ones in their paths.

        <http://webkit.org/b/28393> check-webkit-style: add check for use of std::max()/std::min() instead of MAX()/MIN()

        Reviewed by David Levin.

        * Scripts/modules/cpp_style.py:
        (_ERROR_CATEGORIES): Added 'runtime/max_min_macros'.
        (check_max_min_macros): Added.  Returns level 4 error when MAX()
        and MIN() macros are used in header files and C++ source files.
        (check_style): Added call to check_max_min_macros().
        * Scripts/modules/cpp_style_unittest.py: Added unit tests.
        (test_max_macro): Added.
        (test_min_macro): Added.

        (-[DumpRenderTreeWindow close]): Resolved crashes seen during regression
        tests. The close method can be called on a window that's already closed
        so we can't assert here.
