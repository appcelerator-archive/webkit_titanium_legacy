    \class QWebInspector
    \since 4.6
    \brief The QWebInspector class allows the placement and control of a
    QWebPage's inspector.
    The inspector allows you to see a page current hierarchy and loading
    statistics.

    The QWebPage to be inspected is determined with the setPage() method.

    A typical use of QWebInspector follows:

    \snippet webkitsnippets/qtwebkit_qwebinspector_snippet.cpp 0

    \note A QWebInspector will display a blank widget if either:
    \list
        \o page() is null
        \o QWebSettings::DeveloperExtrasEnabled is false
    \endlist

    \section1 Resources

    Most of the resources needed by the inspector are owned by the associated
    QWebPage and are allocated the first time that:
    \list
        \o an element is inspected
        \o the QWebInspector is shown.
    \endlist

    This class acts mostly as a container and a controller for the inspector.
    You can defer the creation and association of the QWebInspector until
    the first emission of QWebPage::webInspectorTriggered() to save additional
    resources.

    \section1 Inspector configuration persistence

    The inspector allows the user to configure some options through its
    interface (e.g. the resource tracking "Always enable" option).
    These settings are persisted automatically by QtWebKit using QSettings.

    However since the QSettings object is instantiated using the empty
    constructor, QCoreApplication::setOrganizationName() and
    QCoreApplication::setApplicationName() must be called within your
    application to enable the persistence of these options.
