        <rdar://problem/7044385> Crash at NetscapePlugInStreamLoader::didReceiveResponse()

        The crash was caused by having two streams with a streamID of 1.

        * Plugins/Hosted/NetscapePluginInstanceProxy.mm:
        (WebKit::NetscapePluginInstanceProxy::NetscapePluginInstanceProxy): Fixed a typo. Now
        correctly increments m_currentURLRequestID to account for the manual stream.
        (WebKit::NetscapePluginInstanceProxy::disconnectStream): If the stream is the manual stream,
        null it out instead of trying to remove it from the map. Added an assertion.
        (WebKit::NetscapePluginInstanceProxy::loadRequest): Added an assertion.
