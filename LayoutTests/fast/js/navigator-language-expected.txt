Test for bug 29653: [Qt] Qt-based browser fails to show the right language translation.
Language tags should follow the specification below:
2.1.1.  Formatting of Language Tags

   At all times, language tags and their subtags, including private use
   and extensions, are to be treated as case insensitive: there exist
   conventions for the capitalization of some of the subtags, but these
   MUST NOT be taken to carry meaning.
On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".


PASS navigator.language.substring(0,2) is 'en'
PASS successfullyParsed is true

TEST COMPLETE
