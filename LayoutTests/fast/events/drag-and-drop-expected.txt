This test checks that drag-and-drop support works and conforms to the HTML 5 specification.
For each effectAllowed, iterates through the possible dropEffects: none, copy, move, link, dummy.

Note, this test fails when effectAllowed == "uninitialized" because this effect has not been implemented yet (see bug #30291).

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".
