        The patch also makes a element without href behave like generic elements
        when it comes to focus. Added tests that asserts that this works as
        expected.

        Fix Bug 27827 "[Chromium] Functions Keys don't work in google spreadsheet".
        <https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=27827>.

        Because of the lack of mappings from GDK key-codes to WebKit key-codes,
        Chromium cannot send valid key-codes to JavaScript when a user types
        function keys. This change just copies the mappings from 'KeyEventGtk.cpp'.

        To write layout tests for this issue, added mappings from function-key
        names to platform-specific key-codes to EventSendingController objects
        so that eventSender.keyDown() can send function-key events without using
        platform-specific key codes. (Unfortunately, this eventSender.keyDown() change
        is only for Mac. So this change adds this new test to Skipped tests for other
        platforms to prevent this change from crashing the build trees.)

        It modifies the order in which tag appear in toggle-style-2 to match the actual result

        This patch converts editing/style/underline.html and editing/style/remove-underline.html to a dumpAsText test.

        It also adds runDumpAsTextEditingTest which invokes a new testing mode.
        runDumpAsTextEditingTest calls user-defined editingTest just like runEditingTest but does not enable editing delegates by default.
        It logs innerHTML of the node with id "root" whenever the DOM is changed by exec* functions with the name of function in front.
        It should be used in tests where logging of selection and caret positions is not required but logging
        of how DOM changed over editing operations is required.

        Convert two layout tests so that they use dumpAsText().
        
        These tests check if the renderer crashes or not. Hence, we do not need to
        dump the entire render tree. I verified DumpRenderTree at r24513 still crashed
        when it opened the updated test cases.
        
        See bug 14714 for details about these test cases.

        Make the DRT APIs to pause transitions and animations work for accelerated animations
        <https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=27627>

        Fix the 'pauseAnimationAtTimeOnElementWithId' and 'pauseTransitionAtTimeOnElementWithId' APIs
        available to LayoutTests to work with accelerated animations and transitions. Done by sending
        the pause time down to the GraphicsLayer, and using it to stop time on the layer.
        
        I also added an assertion to check that the animation has actually started when we
        try to pause it, to check that the pause time we compute is valid. This revealed a number
        of tests that tried to pause before animations started, required some amount of test fixing.

        Add new test to cover more prototype/constructor inheritance cases
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=27622

        This new test tries hard not to duplicate testing done
        by other tests and instead test new objects and prototype chains
        which will be fixed as soon as toJS is passed through the globalObject.

        This test crawls the object tree under the inner window, finding
        one of each type of JavaScript object.  It depends on all objects having
        a valid prototype chain with a unique name (which is not always the case).
        The test tries to stress the cases where the objects would be lazily
        creating other objects or their prototypes or constructors which would
        require these objects to have a back-pointer to the globalObject to be
        able to correctly wire up the prototype chains.

        Refactoring of indentRegion to fix bugs 26816 and 25317
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=26816
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=25317
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=23995 (partially)

        This patch implements appendParagraphIntoNode, a simpler specialized version of moveParagraph
        and replaces all calls inside indentRegion. The following is the new behavior of indentRegion.

        1. We try to indent as many wrapping nodes as possible.
           e.g. when indenting "hello" in <div>hello</div>, we try to indent div as well.
        2. We do not delete any wrapping elements
           With moveParagraph, we used to remove all wrapping nodes, and replaced with a blockquote.
           This was causing https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=23995 for indentation.
           With appendParagraphIntoNode, we can preserve all wrapping nodes.
        3. We only split the tree until the closest block node instead of until the root editable node.
           This behavioral change fixes the bug 25317.
        4. When multiple paragraphs are indented, we indent the highest common ancestor within the selection.
           e.g. when a list is a child node of a div, and the entire div is intended,
                we enclose the div by a single blockquote.
        
        Note that new behavior is more consistent with that of Internet Explorer and Firefox.
        To demonstrate this, the following tests are added and rebaselined.

        Incorrect animation when trying to duplicate effect of transform-origin

        Test showing bug. This test actually passes LayoutTests with or
        without the bug fixed. This is because we snapshot at a keyframe
        at which point the value is always correct. And we can't do a
        LayoutTest which snapshots the wrong value because it is buried
        in the hardware renderer, which we can't get to. But if you
        visually inspect this test you can see the incorrect behavior.

        Rubber-stamped by Oliver Hunt.

        Tweak mouseout-dead-subframe.html to be more robust.

        The test calls notifyDone() and then dumpAsText(). The latter call has no effect
        as notifyDone() performs the dump, but it passes in the mac DRT because the mime-type
        of the .html file is detected as text/plain and therefore the text is dumped instead
        of the render tree.

        Changed the testcase to call dumpAsText() first and then notifyDone(), to make it
        pass without relying on the mime type detection.

        That also makes the test pass in the Qt DRT.

        * fast/events/mouseout-dead-subframe.html: Swapped notifyDone() and dumpAsText() calls to
        call the former before the latter.
        * platform/qt/Skipped: Removed skipped test.

        fast/js/global-recursion-on-full-stack.html is a little finicky.

        The test recurses down the JS stack to find the bottom (catching this with an exception),
        then tries to call a host function (document.write), switch writes new '<script>' code,
        and expects this code to be run, then expects this code to try to call 'f();' again,
        which it expects to fail, and it expects to catch that exception.  However it is possible
        that one of the earlier stages (the call to document.write, entering the interpreter to
        run the new global code) will fail, depending on exactly how much stack space was free at
        the point the last call to f() failed.

        Tweak the test to make it work.

        Make unconfirmed IME text affect textarea's value.

        This fixes https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=25061.

        Input elements would go down this code path because it

        Special casing compositionNodes is wrong because we explicitly
        want unconfirmed IME input in the textarea's value (assuming we

        Increase delay in worker-terminate layout test to make it more reliable.

        This test used time delay to see of terminated worker does not return
        messages (terminated). In some test conditions, the current delay (500ms)
        is too short and test fails. Move setting the delay to the end of initialization

        Land new results from my change to make replaced elements no longer be overflow:hidden by
        default.  This affected plaintext dumping, which is clearly a bug in and of itself.  For now
        I am just updating the results and will file a followup bug about the fact that text dumping actually
        does something different with overflow on replaced elements (when it clearly should not).

        Bug 26156: In view-source mode, always render the contents using HTMLViewSourceDocument
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=26156

        When in view-source mode, render the contents using HTMLViewSourceDocument
        regardless it's applicable for any plugin or not.

        Chromium tells WebCore to render the contents of specified URL when
        view-source: prefix is added to the URL. But currently, DOMImplementation
        ignores inViewSourceMode() when the MIME type is indicating that the contents
        are neither texts nor HTML family documents.

        For example, we can check the contents of asf file without launching media
        player. Rendering contents for view-source:-specified input is not what user
        expects.

        http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=10545

        I want to fix this issue by this patch. IMHO, regardless of this Chromium
        specific issue, I think we should force use of HTMLViewSourceDocument when
        inViewSourceMode() is specified.

        Add an additional test for bug 23786 (mistreatment of CR/LF 
        as zero-width characters in Chromium port).  Tests using Bidi text were
        added when the fix was checked in. Without the patch, Chromium used
        to fail the same way with LTR complex scripts as well. (that is,
        CR and LF were treated as zero-width space). To prevent a potential
        regression in the future, a new test with Hindi (a LTR complex script)
        is added. 

        The expected results for Mac and Windows are added while this test
        is added to Skipped file for gtk. I guess this test just needs
        a new test result generated on gtk.

        Undo the changeset 21212 to fix the regression bug 14062.
        The changeset 21212 attempted to fix rdar://problem/5002441.
        The changeset 21212 modified InsertTextCommand::input so as to convert
        all spaces in text to non-breaking spaces for rdar://problem/5002441.
        However, the bug was originally caused by rebalanceWhitespaceAt
        and this workaround introduced a regression bug 14062.
        Because rebalanceWhitespaceAt appears to behave correctly now,
        the workaround introduced in 21212 is no longer needed.

        The following test cases are affected by this change.
        This patch removes unappropriate non-breaking spaces (&nbsp;) and
        inserts normal spaces instead.
