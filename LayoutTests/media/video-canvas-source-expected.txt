Test to ensure we don't taint a canvas when drawing from a video the uses source elements rather than the src attribute

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".


 
PASS !!ctx.getImageData(0, 0, width, height) is true
RUN(var source = document.createElement('source'); source.src = 'content/counting.mp4'; video.appendChild(source))
EVENT(canplaythrough)
END OF TEST
